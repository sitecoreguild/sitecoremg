# Builds - Sitecore Mentoring Guild
This folder will store builds/installs of applications/components to help others on their Sitrecore journey.

## Application/Component List

Any applications or components should be referenced in the Wiki so they are more easily found.
If external documentation exists please link to it rather than adding it here. This will help keep content fresh.

1. {Apps}: This folder stores the build/install for the application or component.

Any code, installs, documentation provided here will be treated as free to share by anyone.  Please do not put anything here that cannot be shared or is under NDA.
Let's continue to learn more about Sitecore together.

NOTE: Some of these files will be generated from other sources. These items will be tagged at the top as follows:

    ---------- (AUTOGENERATED FROM REPUTATION ENGINE) ----------

If items are tagged with this please look for another file in the folder that will start with COMGEN_ these files can be edited and the contents will be merged back into the Reputation Engine for processing.
